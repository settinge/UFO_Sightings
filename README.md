# javascript-challenge

I created a webpage that creates a table dynamically based upon a set of data around UFO sightings (data.js). Additional functionality included the ability for users to 
filter the table data for specific values. 

Languages used includes: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js.

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search 

* Created a basic HTML web page (index.html)

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appends a table to my web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

*  Columns included: `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.

* Used a date form in my HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that listens for events and searches through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.
